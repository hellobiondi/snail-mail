# Project Snail Mail

Snail Mail is an online social networking portal that enables our users to connect with new people, both locally and internationally, through a virtual simulated mail and parcel network to **promote a slower pace of life.**

## Description

As we are living in a fast-paced society, we hope to promote a slower pace of life through Snail Mail. Snail Mail aims to allow users to relax and take things slowly when meeting new people - by delaying mail/parcel delivery according to geographic distance.

Moreover, as our users send countless Snail Mails to their new companions, the waiting period brings back the nostalgic feeling of anticipation we got when we were younger from waiting for mail in our letterbox. Connected users can also choose to engage in various mini games, where a player can only make a move after the other player has done so, like ‘Correspondence connect 4’
